# Don't Quit Me!
This is a very simple windows-only mod that disables the close button on the game window so you don't accidentally click it when moving to a second monitor.

X button grays out on game launch, can be re-enabled by pressing F10.

## Dev Notice
If you pull this repo to modify the code, remember the change the GamePath property in the csproj file to your own game location.
